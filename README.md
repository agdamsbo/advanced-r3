# AdvancedR3: Course material and tasks for [Advanced Reproducible Research in R](https://ddeacademy.dk/events/course/advanced-course-on-reproducible-research-in-radvanced-course-on/)

~~TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about~~

This project is about learning reproducible and sharrable code

# Brief description of folder and file contents

~~TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, doc and R folders.~~

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: Contains modified data to use
-   `doc/`: Contains exported documents
-   `R/`: Contains R functions

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_deps()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.
